## Overview

Hey there, welcome to my portfolio! ✨
I recently completed the Meta Data Analyst with GenAI Professional Certificate, where I picked up hands-on experience in data analysis, data management, and data visualization. This space highlights the projects and exercises I tackled along the way, showcasing how I apply key concepts and tools to real data challenges. 🚀📊

## Projects
### 1. Data Analysis with Spreadsheets and SQL
* Objective: Learn how to clean, explore, and visualize a dataset to uncover insights and present them effectively.
* What I've Done: Scrubbed the data for errors and duplicates, analyzed it in Google Sheets using formulas and SQL queries, and created visualizations in Tableau Public.
* What I've Learnt: Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL-based querying, and interactive dashboard creation.
* Technologies Used: Google Sheets, SQL (within Sheets), Tableau Public.

### 2. Python Data Analytics
* Objective: Learn how to use Python to manipulate datasets as an alternative to spreadsheets, following the OSEMN framework for data analysis.​
* What I've Done: Basic Python programming, including variables, data types, and conditional statements, as well as using Pandas for data loading, selection, and cleaning.
* What I've Learnt: Sort, query, and structure data in Pandas, model and interpret data, and create basic data visualizations with Python libraries.
* Technologies Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### 3. Statistics Foundations
* Objective: Learn the basic principles of descriptive and inferential statistics to make data-driven decisions.
* What I've Done: Analyzed Facebook and AdWords conversion data by performing descriptive statistics, conducting hypothesis testing with a t-test, and building a simple linear regression model to predict outcomes and provide final recommendations.
* What I've Learnt: How to formulate and test hypotheses. How to use measures of central tendency, spread, distributions, and variable types to understand a dataset. How to create and interpret various statistical models like linear regression, cluster analysis, and time series using Tableau.
* Technologies Used: Google Sheets, Google Slides and Tableau Public.
